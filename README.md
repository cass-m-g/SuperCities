============
This folder contains a project for an android app developed on eclipse. Most of the main code can be found deep within the source folder. I have not changed the structure of the folders in order to maintain compatability with the eclipse IDE.

The app is very simple, it has a few screens which can be switched between. (NOTE: this app assumes you have a back button on your phone) When you switch between the "Pick your crime" page to another it sends a signal through the internet using Syncano's API to a specific computer. The idea behind this app was to be the criminal of the hero's game on the computer. So as a criminal you would pick your crime and the app would send information about the crime to the hero, who would go to the location using the oculus and fight the crime. (The code on here is only for the android app.)
